## ANALYSIS
**_NOTE_** : _**14** Customer's ID data was not made available from the onset of the analysis, so they were flagged and were not represneted in any visual._
Also some customers didnt give their color choices on an item before purchasing. It was assumed they were okay with any color available as at the time. Hence categorizing those data as **Not Specific**

- Two different slicers were added to show results on all the visuals according to what is been selected
  
SLICER 1: **ITEMS PURCHASED**

SLICER 2: **FREQUENCY OF PURCHASE**

- Visual of the top 10 products ordered, **Jeweleries, Pants, and Blouse** are the top selling product with **171 orders** each
- Top 10 fast selling color choices on products is also presented, with **Olive** coming in first with  **176 product orders** and **Maroon** coming in last **158 product orders**
- The orders also varies across seasons.
 Ranking from highest to the least; Spring, Fall, Winter, Summer with 1000, 975, 971, 955 orders respectively.
- Target audience performance based on gender; It was shown that the gender with a major turnout between the male and female gender were the **males** with a turnout of **2653 : 1248**

## CONCLUSION
- Total revenue generated = $233,132
- Number of orders receieved = 3901
- Male gender dominates the target audience
- Customers are really specific on the colors of products they want


## RECOMMENDATION
- Products not in the Top 10 peforming list should be looked into, and possibly organize a campaign PR strategy to push them in the marketing world.
- More feminine like products and designs could be added to the list, so as to capture the female gender target audience.
- Colors that are not really selling out could be dropped and the resources could be invested into increase production of items with colors that are highly requested.
